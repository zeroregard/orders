# Auto-Order Backend Deployment Strategy

This document outlines the deployment strategy for the Auto-Order backend, including recommended hosting options, authentication solutions, environment setup, and CI/CD workflows.

## Hosting Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation: Railway.app

Railway.app is an ideal platform for hosting the Auto-Order backend for the following reasons:

1. **Integrated PostgreSQL Management**: Native support for PostgreSQL databases with automated backups and easy scaling.
2. **Automatic Deployments**: Seamless GitHub integration with auto-deployments on push.
3. **Environment Variables**: Easy management of environment secrets and configuration.
4. **Preview Deployments**: Supports isolated preview deployments for pull requests.
5. **Reasonable Pricing**: Starter tier suitable for personal projects with predictable pricing.

### Alternative Options

1. **Render.com**: Similar to Railway with PostgreSQL support, easy deployments, and reasonable pricing.
2. **Fly.io**: Good for global deployments if your application needs to serve users in multiple regions.
3. **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Reliable PaaS with good PostgreSQL integration.
4. **Heroku**: Traditional option with mature tooling, but more expensive for hobby projects.

## Authentication Implementation

### Recommended: Auth0

Auth0 provides a comprehensive authentication solution that balances security and developer experience:

1. **Features**:
   - Social logins (Google, GitHub, etc.)
   - Email/password authentication
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - JWT token-based authentication
   - Role-based access control

2. **Integration Steps**:
   1. Create an Auth0 account and set up an API application
   2. Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      pnpm add express-oauth2-jwt-bearer
      ```
   3. Configure Auth0 middleware for route protection:
      ```typescript
      import { auth } from 'express-oauth2-jwt-bearer';

      const checkJwt = auth({
        audience: 'https://auto-order-api',
        issuerBaseURL: 'https://<YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN>/',
      });

      // Protected route example
      app.get('/api/products', checkJwt, productsRouter);
      ```

3. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Define roles in Auth0 (e.g., Admin, User)
   - Include permissions in access tokens
   - Verify permissions with middleware

### Alternative: NextAuth.js (if migrating to Next.js API Routes)

If considering a Next.js migration for a full-stack approach:

1. Benefits:
   - Simplified auth flow integration
   - Built-in session management
   - Less API configuration required

2. Integration:
   - Move API routes to Next.js `/api` directory
   - Leverage NextAuth.js for auth handling

## Database Considerations

### PostgreSQL on Railway or Similar

1. **Connection Management**:
   - Use connection pooling via Prisma
   - Store connection string in environment variables
   - Set up read replicas for scaling if needed

2. **Migration Strategy**:
   - Run Prisma migrations as part of the deployment pipeline
   - Consider using a migration approval step for production

3. **Backup Strategy**:
   - Daily automated backups (provider-managed)
   - Weekly manual backups for critical data
   - Test restoration process quarterly

## Environment Configuration

Create multiple environments with appropriate configurations:

1. **Development**:
   - Local PostgreSQL database
   - Auth0 development tenant or local auth
   - DEBUG logs enabled

2. **Staging**:
   - Isolated database instance
   - Non-production Auth0 tenant
   - Rate limiting enabled but higher than production
   - Staging-specific variables

3. **Production**:
   - Production-grade PostgreSQL instance
   - Production Auth0 tenant
   - Strict rate limiting
   - Production monitoring
   - No DEBUG logs

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables:

```
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database

# Auth0
AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-tenant.auth0.com
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://auto-order-api
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL=https://your-tenant.auth0.com/

# Application
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production
API_VERSION=v1
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-domain.com

# Optional
LOG_LEVEL=info
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=60000
```

## Scaling Considerations

For future growth:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer
   - Ensure instances are stateless
   - Use distributed caching if needed (Redis)

2. **Database Scaling**:
   - Consider read replicas for high-read traffic
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Set up proper indexes for common queries

3. **Rate Limiting & Protection**:
   - Implement API rate limiting
   - Consider using a service like Cloudflare for DDoS protection

## Monitoring and Observability

1. **Logging**:
   - Structured JSON logging with Winston
   - Log aggregation with a service like LogRocket or Datadog

2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - New Relic or Datadog for APM
   - Track key endpoints' response times
   - Set up alerting for critical issues

3. **Uptime Monitoring**:
   - Set up health check endpoint at `/api/health`
   - Use UptimeRobot or similar for external monitoring
   - Configure alerts for downtime

## Deployment Process

1. **Pre-Deployment Checks**:
   - Run linting and tests
   - Check TypeScript compilation
   - Validate API schema
   - Run security audits (npm audit)

2. **Deployment Steps**:
   - Build TypeScript to JavaScript
   - Run Prisma migrations
   - Start application with proper environment
   - Run smoke tests

3. **Post-Deployment**:
   - Verify health check endpoint
   - Monitor logs for errors
   - Check key endpoints functionality

## Rollback Strategy

In case of deployment failures:

1. Automatically roll back to the last successful deployment if health checks fail
2. Keep the last 5 successful deployments as rollback targets
3. Have a documented manual rollback procedure

## Security Considerations

1. **HTTPS**: Enforce HTTPS for all API traffic
2. **CORS**: Properly configure CORS for allowed origins
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-IP and per-user rate limiting
4. **Input Validation**: Continue using Zod for request validation
5. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular npm audit checks
6. **JWT Security**: Properly validate tokens, set appropriate expiration
7. **Database Security**: Use prepared statements (ensured by Prisma)

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. Set up Auth0 account and configure application
2. Configure Railway.app project and link to GitHub repository
3. Set up environment variables in Railway dashboard
4. Configure GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD pipeline
5. Implement authentication middleware in the Express application
6. Update API endpoints to require authentication as appropriate
7. Deploy initial version and verify authentication flow
